# mood-board-fetcher
creates a mood board from a personlized image database
# WIP...
## What works:
- DB is searchable by artist
- User can query multiple artist
- User can specify how many images are returned (Capped at 30)
- Results are randomized as is most useful for reference gathering
- User can save an image as a favorite
## TODO:
- Search by keyword
- ...
- Add user profiles
